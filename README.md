# python-koans-completed

This is my attempt at completing all the tests in Python Koans using Python 3. Since I'm learning Python along the way I have included 
in depth notes as I complete each of the test files for reference.

## Notes

 * Booleans are capitalized: `True` and `False`
 * Method name ends in semi-colon and no ending indicator (whitespace sensitive like CoffeeScript?)
